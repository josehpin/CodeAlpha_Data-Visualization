##  Project Overview
This project focuses on *transforming raw data into meaningful visual insights* using Python-based data visualization techniques.  
The Titanic dataset is used to explore passenger survival patterns through clear and informative charts and graphs that support data-driven decision-making.

The visualizations are designed to be *easy to understand, **insightful, and **portfolio-ready*, following best practices in data storytelling.

---

##  Objectives
- Transform raw data into visual formats such as charts and graphs  
- Use *Matplotlib* and *Seaborn* for effective data visualization  
- Design visuals that clearly reveal trends, patterns, and relationships  
- Craft meaningful data stories to support analytical insights  
- Build a strong data visualization portfolio for internship and career growth

## Dataset
- *Name:* Titanic Dataset  
- *Source:* Kaggle  
- *File Used:* tested.csv  
- *Description:* Contains passenger information such as age, gender, class, fare, and survival status

## Tools & Libraries Used
- *Python*
- *Pandas*
- *NumPy*
- *Matplotlib*
- *Seaborn*
- *Google Colab*
- *GitHub*

##  Visualizations Created
The following visualizations were implemented to analyze and present insights clearly:

- Survival count of passengers  
- Survival comparison by gender  
- Survival analysis by passenger class  
- Age distribution of passengers  
- Fare distribution vs survival status  
- Correlation heatmap of numerical features  
- Survival patterns based on embarkation port  

Each visualization helps answer a specific business or analytical question related to passenger survival.

##  Key Insights
- Female passengers had a higher survival rate compared to males  
- Passengers in higher classes showed better survival chances  
- Fare and passenger class have a relationship with survival  
- Age distribution shows most passengers were young to middle-aged adults  
- Certain numerical features exhibit correlations

##  How to Run the Project
1. Open the notebook file (.ipynb) in *Google Colab*
2. Upload the dataset file tested.csv
3. Run all cells to view visual outputs and insights
